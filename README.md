 - The [`Data`](Data/SuperStore_Sales_Dataset.csv) directory contains the raw dataset used for this analysis in CSV and Excel files.
   
 - The dataset contains historical sales and profit data for two years i.e 2019 and 2020, customer information, product information, regional data, and order information. The data was carefully sourced from reliable online resources to ensure data accuracy and reliability.
   
 - Thorough data cleaning and preprocessing were executed through Python libraries and Power Query. This entailed rectifying data inconsistencies, managing missing data points, and dealing with outlier values. Furthermore, we applied data transformations to prepare the data for analysis ensuring data integrity. This data cleaning and preprocessing has been documented in the [`Python File`](Python/CSV%20File/Super_Store_Sales_Dataset.ipynb) directory in ".ipynb" format.
